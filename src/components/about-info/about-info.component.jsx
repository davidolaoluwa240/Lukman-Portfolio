          I'm Lukman Suleiman, a versatile designer from Nigeria. My passion
          lies in crafting impactful products that hold the potential to make a
          significant difference in people's lives. I firmly believe that such
          endeavours not only spur innovation but also fuel market growth.

          As a product designer, I'm driven by a commitment to exceptional user
          experiences that go beyond the ordinary. I aim to empower users
          through intuitive and visually appealing interfaces that enhance their
          digital interactions.

        <p>
          Outside of design, I'm an avid reader, finding inspiration and
          perspective in the pages of diverse books. I've also contributed to
          design education by training over 200 individuals worldwide, currently
          teaching at Verdac Design School and mentoring through ADPlist, with a
          goal to inspire aspiring designers to make positive contributions.

          Passionate about cutting-edge technologies, I have a strong interest
          in emerging fields including blockchain, TV and game interface
          design/experience, voice interfaces, virtual and mixed reality,
          wearables, financial technology, assistive technology, and cognitive
          psychology for enhancing user experiences (UX). I'm deeply involved in
          the entire design process, from discovery to prototyping and user
          testing.
